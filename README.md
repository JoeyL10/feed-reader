# Project Overview

In this project Udacity students are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We have to explore the Jasmine documentation and come up with functions to test javascript code.


## Tests in this application

	There are 4 test suites that include the following test script objectives:


	* Feeds are defined
	* Feed URLs are defined and not empty
	* Menu is hidden by default
	* Menu slides in and out when clicked
	* loadFeed function is called and contains at least one entry
	* loadFeed content changes when new feed is loaded



## How to run this

[View the live site hosted on Github] (https://joeyl10.github.io/feed-reader/)

Or download the repo to your desktop by clicking "Clone or download" button

*  Open index.html and view test results at the bottom of the screen.
*  View test scripts in feadreader.js
